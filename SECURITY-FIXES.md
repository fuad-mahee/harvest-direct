# Authentication Security Fixes - Harvest Direct

## üîí Security Issue Identified
**Problem**: Users could access unauthorized dashboards after logging in. For example:
- An admin could access farmer and consumer dashboards
- A farmer could access admin and consumer dashboards  
- A consumer could access admin and farmer dashboards

This was a critical security vulnerability that exposed sensitive data and functionality to unauthorized users.

## ‚úÖ Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Library (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
**Added new functions:**
- `hasRole()` - Check if user has specific role
- `hasAnyRole()` - Check if user has any of specified roles
- `redirectToDashboard()` - Smart redirect based on user role
- `requireRole()` - Enforce specific role access
- `handleUnauthorizedAccess()` - Handle access violations gracefully

### 2. Created Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
**Features:**
- `useAuth(requiredRole)` - Comprehensive authentication check with role validation
- `useRequireAuth()` - Basic authentication requirement
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access
- Loading states for better UX
- Clear error messages for access violations

### 3. Updated All Dashboard Pages

#### Admin Dashboard (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
```typescript
const { user, loading, authorized } = useAuth('ADMIN');
// Only ADMIN role can access this page
```

#### Farmer Dashboard (`src/app/farmer/page.tsx`)
```typescript
const { user, loading, authorized } = useAuth('FARMER');
// Only FARMER role can access this page
```

#### Consumer Dashboard (`src/app/consumer/page.tsx`)
```typescript
const { user, loading, authorized } = useAuth('CONSUMER');
// Only CONSUMER role can access this page
```

### 4. Enhanced Navigation Component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
**Security Features:**
- Role-based menu visibility
- Dynamic navigation based on user authentication
- Secure logout functionality
- User role display in mobile menu

### 5. Created Additional Security Components

#### AuthGuard (`src/components/AuthGuard.tsx`)
- Global route protection
- Automatic role validation
- Graceful handling of unauthorized access

#### RoleGuard (`src/components/RoleGuard.tsx`)
- Component-level role restriction
- Flexible role-based content display
- Custom error messages

## üõ°Ô∏è How Security Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Login**: User logs in with credentials
2. **Role Assignment**: System assigns correct role (ADMIN/FARMER/CONSUMER)
3. **Route Protection**: Each dashboard checks user role before rendering
4. **Access Control**: Unauthorized users are redirected to their appropriate dashboard

### Access Control Matrix:
| User Role | Admin Dashboard | Farmer Dashboard | Consumer Dashboard |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| ADMIN     | ‚úÖ Access     | ‚ùå Denied       | ‚ùå Denied        |
| FARMER    | ‚ùå Denied     | ‚úÖ Access       | ‚ùå Denied        |
| CONSUMER  | ‚ùå Denied     | ‚ùå Denied       | ‚úÖ Access        |

### Error Handling:
- **Unauthorized Access**: Clear error message + redirect to correct dashboard
- **No Authentication**: Redirect to login page
- **Invalid Role**: Graceful error handling with appropriate messaging

## üîç Testing the Fix

### Test Cases:
1. **Login as Admin** ‚Üí Should only access `/admin`
2. **Login as Farmer** ‚Üí Should only access `/farmer`  
3. **Login as Consumer** ‚Üí Should only access `/consumer`
4. **Manual URL Access** ‚Üí Should redirect unauthorized users
5. **Navigation Links** ‚Üí Should only show appropriate role links

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Users can only access their designated dashboard
- ‚úÖ Manual URL navigation shows access denied message
- ‚úÖ Navigation menu adapts to user role
- ‚úÖ Logout works properly across all roles
- ‚úÖ Loading states provide good UX

## üöÄ Additional Security Benefits

### Enhanced User Experience:
- Role-appropriate navigation menus
- Personalized welcome messages
- Smooth transitions and loading states
- Clear error messaging

### System Security:
- Server-side role validation (existing API endpoints)
- Client-side role enforcement (new implementation)
- Secure session management
- Proper logout functionality

## üîß Implementation Notes

### Files Modified:
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced authentication utilities
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - New authentication hook
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added role protection
- `src/app/farmer/page.tsx` - Added role protection  
- `src/app/consumer/page.tsx` - Added role protection
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Role-based navigation
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Improved login experience

### Files Created:
